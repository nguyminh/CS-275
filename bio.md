My name is Minh Nguyen. I am on the 2- year track here at Oregon State University for the Ecampus Computer Science program.
My previous bachelor's degree was in Biology, and I'm intending on joining the field of bioinformatics after getting a stronger background with computer science.

My hobbies include and are not limited to biking, playing music (guitar & bass), writing code (not a joke), video games, hikes, and traveling.  

I hope that this class will equip me with the knowledge that I need to be able to become a better computer scientist. 


And right here, I'm just adding more info for my master branch that is going to be merged with the programming branch. Hopefully this works.
