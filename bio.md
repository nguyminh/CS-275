My name is Minh Nguyen. I am on the 2- year track here at Oregon State University for the Ecampus Computer Science program.
My previous bachelor's degree was in Biology, and I'm intending on joining the field of bioinformatics after getting a stronger background with computer science.

My hobbies include and are not limited to biking, playing music (guitar & bass), writing code (not a joke), video games, hikes, and traveling.  

I hope that this class will equip me with the knowledge that I need to be able to become a better computer scientist. 


---Programming background---

My favorite project in cs 161 was the very last one, where we had to implement eerything we've learned into one program.

Other than this CS program, I've never had any real work on programming besides a little bit of HTML here and there. Which really doesn't even count because I don't remember much of it at all.
